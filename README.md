Instructions
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

This module was a bit challenging for me to try to navigate, but after the web scraping the data was easy to manipulate.
As always I refernced the in class activities especially for the second part when pulling the table directly from the website.
In part 2 when pulling the table the for loops took me a minute to figure out but i referenced this website:
Koech, K. E. (2021, November 18). Web scraping: Scraping table data. Medium. https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-scraping-table-data-1665b6b2271c 
I also useed this website to export my DataFrame to CSV file:
Olumide, S. (2023, June 8). Dataframe to CSV â€“ how to Save Pandas Dataframes by exporting. freeCodeCamp.org. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dataframe-to-csv-how-to-save-pandas-dataframes-by-exporting/
